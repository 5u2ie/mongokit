= Signals =

Signals can be mapped to a field. Each time a field will changed, the function
will be called. A signal is called before field validation so you can make some
field processing:
    
    signals = {
        "key1.foo": lambda doc, value: doc['bla'] = unicode(value)
    }

This means that each time key1.foo will be changed, the value of field "bla" will
change to. You can make more complicated signals. A signals return nothing.

Juste like validators, you can specify multiple signals for one field.
